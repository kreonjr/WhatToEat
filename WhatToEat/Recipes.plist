Cook the noodles as you would regularly. Drain all the broth. Arrange in the center of the tortilla and roll. Works best with large tortillas. This is also really good with cheese and tuna. I would suggest melting the cheese onto the tortilla (microwave), then adding the tuna and then the noodles for that.

        <string>- 2 cups of all purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon of double acting baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon of salt
- 1 1/2 cup of coarsely grated extra sharp Cheddar cheese, about 6 ounces
- 1 1/2 cup of heavy cream
            
Into a bowl sift together the flour, baking powder and salt, add the Cheddar cheese, and combine the mixture well. Add the cream and stir the mixture until it just forms a dough. Gather the dough into a ball, knead it gently 6 times on a lightly floured surface, and roll it or pat it out 1/2" thick. Cut out as many rounds as possible with a 2 1/2" round cutter dipped in flour and transfer them to an ungreased baking sheet. Gather the scraps, re-roll the dough, and cut out more rounds in the same manner. Bake the biscuits in the middle of a preheated 425ÂºF. oven for 15 - 17 minutes, or until they are golden. Transfer them to a rack, and let them cool for 5 minutes. Makes about 12 biscuits.

        <key>Directions</key>
        <string>- 8 ounces cream cheese, softened
- 2/3 cup butter, softened
- 1 1/3 cup self-rising flour
- Butter, softened or melted, for finishing
            
1 Pulse together the cream cheese, 2/3 cup butter, and 1 cup of flour two or three times in food processor fitted with the knife or dough blade until it comes together in a ball. Turn the dough out onto waxed paper and divide into two rounds. Flatten. Wrap in waxed paper, plastic wrap, or resealable plastic bag, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
            
2 When ready to bake, preheat oven to 425 degrees.
            
3 Lightly sprinkle a board or other clean surface using some of the 1/3 cup reserved flour. Sprinkle the top lightly with flour. With floured hands and a floured rolling pin, roll out one portion of the dough at a time to about 1/4 inch thick. Fold the dough over to make it 1/2 inch thick. For each biscuit, dip a 1 to 1 1/4 inch biscuit cutter into reserved flour and cut out the biscuits, starting at the outside edge and cutting very close together, being careful not to twist the cutter. The scraps may be combined to make additional biscuits, although these scraps make tougher biscuits. Roll out the second portion when ready to bake.
            
4 Using a metal spatula if necessary, move the biscuits to an ungreased baking sheet, placing the biscuits 1 inch apart. Refrigerate the biscuits for 10 to 20 minutes until cold. Bake the biscuits on the top rack of the oven for a total of 10 to 12 minutes until light golden brown. After 6 minutes, rotate the pan in the oven so that the front of the pan is now turned to the back, and check to see if the bottoms are browning too quickly. If so, slide another packing pan underneath to add insulation and retard the browning. Continue baking another 4 to 6 minutes until the biscuits are light golden brown. When the biscuits are done, lightly brush the tops with butter. Turn the biscuits out upside down on a plate to cool slightly. Serve hot, right side up.
            
5 These biscuits may be frozen, unbaked or baked, and reheated.

        <key>Directions</key>
        <string>- 3-5 medium potatoes
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper
            
1 The number of potatoes simply depends upon the number of people you are feeding.
2 Wash and do not peel the potatoes. Microwave on high until mostly done. If using 2-3 small red potatoes for two servings this will be about 2 1/2 minutes.
3 While microwaving the potatoes fill a bowl with iced water. When potatoes are done drop them into the ice water and cut them length wise in half to expedite cooling.
4 When just cool enough to handle quickly shred (inside will probably still be warm so be quick) without peeling them into a frying pan sprayed with Pam or lightly oiled. The peels will remain in your hand after shredding each half, small amount might be seen in the potatoes but not much.
5 If you want to add other items to these then shred them onto a plate first, add the other items and them place in fry pan. You might want to add some diced onion, bacon or bacon bits, shredded cheese, chives or whatever you might imagine.

5 I normally then pop in the fridge a while (say 30 mins) while working on other stuff as it helps the flavour develop.
6 Cook uncut side down for around 5 minutes over low heat on BBQ plate.
7 flip over and cook further 5 minutes with cut side down.
8 return to original position for the last 5 minutes of cooking.
